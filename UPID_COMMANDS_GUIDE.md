## üö® **Important Notes**

### **Safety First**
- Always use `--dry-run` first to see what changes will be made
- The `--force` flag means "I'm sure, don't ask again"
- Local mode (`--local`) is for testing only

### **Getting Help**
- Use `--help` after any command to see its options
- Example: `upid cluster --help`
- Example: `upid optimize --help`

### **Common Patterns**
- Most commands follow: `upid [command] [subcommand] [options]`
- Use `--format` to change how data is displayed
- Use `--output` to save results to a file
