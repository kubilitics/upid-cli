## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
export UPID_BINARY="upid"           # UPID CLI binary path
export CLUSTER_NAME="test-cluster"   # Kubernetes cluster name
export NAMESPACE="default"           # Kubernetes namespace
export TEST_DURATION=300             # Test duration in seconds
```

### Prerequisites
- UPID CLI installed and in PATH
- Kubernetes cluster access (for integration tests)
- kubectl configured (for live testing)
- Sufficient system resources for performance testing

## 📋 Output Files

Each test generates detailed log files:
- `upid_product_test_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`
- `zero_pod_test_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`
- `ml_intelligence_test_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`
- `production_workloads_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`
- `performance_test_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`
- `enterprise_features_test_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`

## 🎯 Business Value

This testing system ensures:
- **Customer Confidence**: All features work as expected
- **Production Readiness**: Comprehensive validation before release
- **Performance Guarantee**: Meets performance requirements
